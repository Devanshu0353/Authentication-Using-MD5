# Authentication-Using-MD5
In information security, user authentication is an essential technique to verify that the person
trying to access the information is the legitimate one. In MD5, the input message may be
arbitrarily large and is processed in 512-bit blocks by executing 64 steps involving the
manipulation of 128-bit blocks. In this paper, user authentication is carried out by applying
MD5 Hash encryption algorithm to encrypt password entered by the user in a web application
during sign-up. The algorithm is used to develop a more secured login procedure to access
the web-based Information System
